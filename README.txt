# LeagueHelper

LeagueHelper is a program created to be used in tandem with the game League of Legends.

The program runs in the background when you have league of legends open, and samples the screen using screenshots.

It is mainly interested in the map portion of the screen where it will try to figure out some things based on the color content.

The main use case was when an aditional enemy would appear on the map out of the darkness, otherwise known as ganking, and there would be additional red content on the map.

It continuously reads these red levels, and if there is a change that reflects what could be a 'gank', then it plays a short sounds, to alert the player.


This sort of program has since been pretty much banned in the rules by Riot Games, but was fun none the less to develop. It also allowed me to learn a little bit about developing using Windows Forms.
